# Movies-Recommender-System
An end-to-end Recommender system project

This project uses TMDB 5000 movie dataset 
link :- https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tmdb/tmdb-movie-metadata
and basics of NLP for recommending movies similar to the selected movie.

I have used streamlit and pickle from exporting the data from jupyter notebook to the app.py
also used TMDB API for accessing the poster path 

Here is the basic demo of the project:
